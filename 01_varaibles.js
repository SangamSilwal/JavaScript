// so bascially while decalring variables in javascript
// we use const var and let



const id = 2334;
var name = "Sangam";
let address = "Balaju";

/*
So basically while printing multiple things at a time
We can use console.table

Here var is a old way of decalring variables in javaScript 
So for decalring variables we should use const and let
because with var there are lot of problems as it is scope dependent

*/
console.table([id,name,address])
