/*
Basically in node their are two type if fun
Async ---> Non- Blocking 
synch --> Blocking


Blocking: Synchronous operations that halt further execution until the current task completes. Example: fs.readFileSync.
Non-blocking: Asynchronous operations that allow other tasks to run while waiting. Example: fs.readFile with a callback or promises.
Non-blocking is key for handling multiple tasks efficiently in Node.js.
